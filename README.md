# COVID-19CaseStudy
An exploratory analysis of variables impacting the number of COVID-19 cases in a county.
Datasets containing metrics of each county in every state of the United States were obtained from https://covid19.census.gov/
These datasets are comprised of county population, land area, population density, income demographics, race demographics, ethnicity demographics, and Covid-19 case and death numbers from 1/22/2020, the first day a case was identified in the USA up to 12/--/2020, the day the data was extracted.
This data study looks to see if there is a connection between the number of COVID-19 cases in a county and the racial or economic make-up of the area.
It is my hypothesis that large counties will have a higher percentage of COVID cases by population.
