# COVID-19CaseStudy
An exploratory analysis of population demographic variables impacting the number of COVID-19 cases in a county.
The dataset containing the number of COVID-19 cases for each county was obtained from https://usafacts.org/.
Datasets containing metrics of each county in every state of the United States were obtained from https://covid19.census.gov/.
These datasets are comprised of county population, land area, population density, income demographics, race demographics, ethnicity demographics, and Covid-19 case and death numbers from 1/22/2020, the first day a case was identified in the USA up to 12/12/2020, the day the data was extracted.
This data study looks to see if there is a connection between the number of COVID-19 cases in a county and the racial or economic make-up of the area.
It is hypothesized that counties with larger population densities will have a higher number of COVID cases.
